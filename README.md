## Course Description

Use n8n - the open source workflow automation tool - to build advanced custom AI-powered business-process automations connecting your existing tools together to create AI agents that simplify your work. Choose n8n as a cloud app, mount it on prem, or run it locally on your computer for full control. Learn how to build an advanced AI agent that connects with external sources like Google Sheets and Slack to perform data processing and management based on natural language inputs. Create, share, and test out automation flows with your team and the n8n community.

## Instructions

This repository contains the n8n workflows and example data used in the course for reference.

To follow along with the course you need:

- an n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- a Google Sheets account with sample data imported
- access to Google Sheets, OpenAI, and Slack accounts

## Installing the Example Data

Full instructions for how to set up the sample data in Google Sheets are provided here: [`example-data/README.md`](example-data/README.md)

## Optional n8n Workflows

The `n8n-workflows/` folder contains JSON files with the finished versions of the workflows covered in the course. You can import these workflows and use them for reference, or follow the course step-by-step to build them out yourself.

The folder also contains the built-out automation flow referenced in the course.

Full setup instructions for how to import the workflows into n8n are provided here: [`n8n-workflows/README.md`](n8n-workflows/README.md)
